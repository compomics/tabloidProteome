                                <p>Because most proteins do not work alone, but rather associate with other proteins to perform their functions,
                                    it is important to know about these associations. It does not help that these associations can take different forms,
                                    such as physical contact in protein-protein interactions, participation in complex formation, or as links in the same signalling
                                    or metabolic pathway. To elucidate as many such protein associations as possible, without being restricted to binary interactions,
                                    we therefore proposed a novel approach to detect protein association based on the re-processing of large-scale, public mass spectrometry
                                    based proteomics data. This approach is based on inferring protein association based on the co-occurrence of proteins across many different
                                    proteomics experiments.</p>
                                <p>Concretely, we reprocess data from the <a target="_blank"

                                    to identify all proteins in each experiment. We then use the peptide counts
                                    for each protein in each experiment to determine highly co-occurring proteins across various mass spectrometry based experiments.

                                <p>The online Tabloid Proteome is the collection of these co-occurring protein pairs, together with their existing biological relation in
                                    existing knowledgebases. In addition to the protein associations we derived, pathway links from Reactome, protein-protein interactions
                                    from IntAct and BioGRID, protein complexes from CORUM, and paralog information from Ensembl are also superimposed. Functional annotation
                                    is provided by disease information from DisGeNET, and Gene Ontology annotations.</p>

                                <li>Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
                                <li>Legal Obligations.

                        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).

                        <div>
                            In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:<br/>
                            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
                            <ul>
                                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

                                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                                <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

                        <div>
                            Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Web and Mobile Analytics: Google Analytics</li>

                        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>


                        <h5>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h5>

                        <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

                        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:compomics.list@gmail.com">compomics.list@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.</p>

                        <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

                        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                        <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

                        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>


                        <h5>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>

                        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
